The jmp instruction:  Unconditional jump to a different part of code.  Essentially a GOTO.
It jumps to a label.  There are 3 types of jumps:
  - short
  - near
  -far
You need to setup a function in the text section so you will have a label.

The jnz, jz, ja, je, etc instructions.  Conditional jump to a different part of the code.  These jumps
rely on the settings of flags in the eflags register.  Flags in this register are set based on the
result of various instructions.  Here are some examples:
  jz location:  Jump to location if zero flag is set (ZF)
  jnz location:  Jump to location if zero flag is not set
  jc location:  Jump to location if carry flag is set (CF)
  jnc location:  Jump to location if carry flag is not set
  je location:  Jump if equal to
  jne location:  Jump if not equal to
  ja location:  Jump if above
  jb location:  Jump if below
  jg location:  Jump if greater
  jge location:  Jump if greater than or equal to
