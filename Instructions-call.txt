call:  The call instruction.  This is basically same as calling a function in C.
When a call instruction is executed, it does 2 things:
  - it pushes the EIP onto the stack
  - it jumps to the call location
Each call must conclude with a RET instruction.  The RET instruction will return
control to the instruction following the call instruction.
