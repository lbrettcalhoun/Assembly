The dec instruction:  Decrement (subtract) 1 byte from an address in a register
Normally used to move ESI backwards after it has been incremented during a
string operation (DF not set causes ESI to increment during string operations).
	- dec %esi:  Move ESI backwards 1 byte

The sub instruction:  Subtract X bytes from an address in a register
Another way to move ESI backwards.
	- subl $2, %esi:  Move ESI backwards 2 bytes
