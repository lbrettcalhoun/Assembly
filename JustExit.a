#
# Simple assembly program which does nothing more than execute exit() syscall
# List of system calls and their identifiers can be found in /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
#
# This program illustrates the basic contents of a simple assembly program (text segment and
# start label) along with the process for calling a syscall function:
#	- Load the syscall function identifier to EAX
#	- Load the parameters to EBX, ECX, EDX, EDI, ESI
#	- Use the interrupt signal to execute the syscall function
#
# AT&T Syntax
#
# Use the following commands to generate the object file and link into the final executable:
#	- as -o JustExit.o JustExit.a
#	- ld  -o JustExit JustExit.o

_start:
	movl $1, %eax	# Load the identifier for exit() syscall (1) into accumulator
	movl $0, %ebx	# Load the parameter (0) into base
	int $0x80	# Use INT 0x80 to execute syscall
