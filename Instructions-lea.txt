The lea instruction:  Load the address of a variable into a register
	- leab:  Load a single byte of the address into an 8 bit register
	- leaw:  Load a word (2 bytes) of the address into a 16 bit register
	- leal:  Load a double word (4 bytes) of the address into a 32 bit register

Note that this does the same thing as the mov instruction ... you can use mov to load the address of a variable
into a register:  movl $HelloWorldString %esi.
