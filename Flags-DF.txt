The DF flag (Decrement Flag):  Controls the increment/decrement of ESI and EDI when performing movs operations.  
If DF is set (1) then ESI and EDI are decremented.  If DF is not set (0) then ESI and EDI are incremented.  In order
to use the REP instruction, DF must be not set (0) which is the default value.

ESI:  Contains address of source string
EDI:  Contains address of destination
