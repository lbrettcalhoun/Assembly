The cmps instruction:  Compare 2 strings
	- cmpsb:  Compare the first byte (8 bits) of 2 strings ... single character
	- cmpsw:  Compare the first word (16 bits) ... 2 characters
	- cmpsl:  Compare the first double word (32 bits) ... 4 characters

EDI:  Contains address of first string memory location
ESI:  Contains address of second string memory location

Result of the comparison is stored in the eflags register: ZF. 

Hmmm ... I forgot ... does the ZF get set if the strings are same or
different?
