The stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) structure which uses PUSH operations to place items on
the stack and uses POP operations to remove items from the stack.  Note that the stack is an
inverse structure; it grows "down" from high memory addresses to lower memory addresses.

High Memory	EBP









Low Memory	ESP
