Virtual memory used to abstract the memory location for each process.  Each process "thinks"
it is the only process on the machine at that time.

BFFFFFFF	Stack:	Function arguments and local variables
		Unused
		Heap:	Dynamic memory (malloc)
		.bss:	Uninitialized data
		.data:  Initialized data
08048000	.text:  Program code

Use /proc/PID/maps to view virtual memory map of any process.  

To determine if a kernel has ASLR enabled, run a process twice and check the virtual memory
map to ensure the stack is located at the same virtual memory location.  All Linux kernels 2.6
and above use ASLR by default.

Disable ASLR:  echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
